    <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
    
    <p>
        This website will become a portfollio of programs I write for CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island during summer session 3 of 2022.<br>
        I created this using HTML and CSS, which I learned through the first week of CSC 106 and through prior knowledge.<br>
        Feel free to explore this website through the navigation bar to learn more about me and my programs.<br>
        This website will be updated weekly.
