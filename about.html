    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h3>An atypical CSC 106 Student</h3>
      
      <p> 
          Hello everyone! My name is Jake Kopacz and I am currently a rising senior in URI's College of Business for Supply Chain Management.<br>
          I'm confident that my academic background is very atypical for a CSC 106 student. However, in the past half year I have become very<br>
          interested in programming. Which has led me to learn python in my free time and take two computer science courses this summer. <br>
          Since I intend to add a minor or major in Computer Science.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Here is a baby photo of me and a selfie of what I currently look like</h3>

      <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
          My main hobby is fitness, I do some form of exercise everyday, which includes lifting weights 6-7 days a week.<br>
          I attribute this hobby to my father who emphesised personal fitness at a young age and introduced me to weight lifying.<br>
          The best part of this hobby is that is a competition with oneself to achieve self determined goals. 
          I truly believe in what Socrates stated <em>"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."</em>
