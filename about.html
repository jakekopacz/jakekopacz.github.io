    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h3>An atypical CSC 106 Student</h3>
      
      <p> 
          Hello everyone! My name is Jake Kopacz and I am currently a rising senior in URI's College of Business for Supply Chain Management.<br>
          I'm confident that my academic background is very atypical for a CSC 106 student. However, in the past half year I have become very<br>
          interested in programming. Which has led me to learn python in my free time and take two computer science courses this summer. <br>
          Since I intend to add a minor or major in Computer Science.
      </p>
