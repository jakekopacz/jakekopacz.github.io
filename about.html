    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h3>An atypical CSC 106 Student</h3>
      
      <div class="center">
      <p> 
          Hello everyone! My name is Jake Kopacz and I am currently a rising senior in URI's College of Business for Supply Chain Management.
          I'm confident that my academic background is very atypical for a CSC 106 student. However, in the past half year I have become very
          interested in programming. Which has led me to learn python in my free time and take two computer science courses this summer.
          Since I intend to add a minor or major in Computer Science.

      <h3> Here is a baby photo of me and a selfie of what I currently look like</h3>

      <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
      
      <div class="center">
      <p>
          My main hobby is fitness, I do some form of exercise everyday, which includes lifting weights 6-7 days a week.
          I attribute this hobby to my father who emphesised personal fitness at a young age and introduced me to weight lifting.
          The best part of this hobby is that is a competition with oneself to achieve self determined goals. Which allows everyone fromn everywhere to practice this hobby.
          I truly believe in what Socrates stated <em>"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."</em>
          I am also an avid skier in the winter and golfer in the summer. Although I dont inticipate ill be doing much golfing this summer, since my full-time
          job and two summer courses will keep me very occupied.

          In addition to fitness, sports captivate the majority of my interests, growing up twenty minutes from Gillete Stadium and playing football
          all through highschool has caused me to religiously folllow collegiate and professional football. With MMA and basketball being close behind( C's win finals in 6).
          It might be basic, but it is what I thoroughly enjoy watching and following more than anything else.

          Lastly, if you're curious about the photo in my banner, it was taken in Palau in 2014. I won a vacation at a scuba convention with dad. 
          These jellyfish are isolated in a lake, on an island, in the ocean which has caused them to lose their stinging ability. 
          Although scuba diving is a hobby im not heavily interested in, and did more so as activity with my dad. I highly recommend trying it, especially in a tropical place.
